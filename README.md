Hey everybody!

I'm Varun and I'm only doing this because I'm pressured by my parents and society to adopt a more programming-based lifestyle and I fet that this would be the easiest given that I am already studying statistics (on a whim, but I digress). 
I hope to not get lost trying to navigate this seemingly infinite field of data science, and at the end of the day,  I would really like to enjoy what I do.
