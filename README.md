# hello-world
Hey everybody!

I'm Varun and I'm only doing this because I'm pressured by my parents and society to adopt a more programming-based lifestyle and I felt that this would be the easiest given that I am already studying statistics (on a whim, but I digress). 
I hope to not get lost trying to navigate this seemingly infinite field of data science, and at the end of the day,  I would really like to enjoy what I do.

UPDATE:
A couple years later and society has won! Yay. 
I will soon start to populate this repo with stuff, but until then, I hope you enjoyed reading the above message, because I know I did.
